## Projects

### [Analysis of Modern Day Video Game Optimization and Reliance on Advancing Hardware](https://amh200264.github.io/Game-Optimization-Study/)

•Leveraged SQL and DataGrip to evaluate hardware requirements and performance metrics across 50+ AAA titles, **identifying a 159% average increase**\
•Created a relational database **tracking 70+ GPUs** (2012–2025), including pricing, release years, and performance benchmarks to analyze hardware evolution.\
•**Calculated 377% performance gaps** between entry-level and high-end GPUs, exemplifying how modern games lack optimization for advancing hardware\
•Developed SQL scripts to compute percentage changes, averages, and trends across **100+ data points**, streamlining analysis of game optimization patterns.\
•Designed charts to compare FPS stability and hardware demands, revealing critical thresholds\
